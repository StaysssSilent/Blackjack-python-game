This project simulates real casino rules using modular programming and structured game logic.

🚀 Features
Random card dealing using Python’s random module
Automatic Blackjack detection
Dynamic Ace value adjustment (11 → 1 when score exceeds 21)
Dealer logic (dealer draws until score ≥ 17)
Replayable game loop

🧠 Concepts Used
Functions & modular programming
Conditional statements
Loops
List manipulation
Game state management

🎮 Rules Implemented
